## üß∞ Technical Aspects

- Data Cleaning and preprocessing.
- Feature Engineering.
- Data Visualization and Analysis.
- Data Normalization and Scaling.
- Training using Sequential Model with Dense Layers having "relu" activation as its a regression problem.
- Compiled using AdamOptmizer as optmizer and Mean squared error (mse) as the loss function.
- Solving Overfitting issues using EarlyStoppings Callbacks and Dropout Layers in Network.
- Hyperparameter Tuning the Algorithms yielding best results.
- Testing the model on custom reallife data.
